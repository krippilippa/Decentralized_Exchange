# Decentralized_exchange

A decentralized exchange exercise from the Ivan on Tech academy course eth-programming 201.

It is a simpeler exchange where one can "buy" tokens with eth, not like uniswap where one can trade tokens for tokens. Then you can sell tokens for eth. All this is, of course, done by "order" fashion - meaning, the user places an order for sell or buy.

While some methods, for example having the orderbook on chain is considered not best practice it is implemented here for educational purposes.
